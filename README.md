## üîç Abstract
**ECOMATIC** is an intelligent, autonomous robot designed for **waste collection, cleaning, and segregation** in public environments such as roadsides, campuses, and parks.  
It employs a **NodeMCU microcontroller** as its core controller, integrating **ultrasonic sensors** for obstacle avoidance, **IR sensors** for navigation, and a **soil moisture sensor** for wet/dry waste classification.  
The system achieves **85% waste collection efficiency** and **88% segregation accuracy**, proving its effectiveness as a **smart city sanitation solution**.

## ‚öôÔ∏è System Overview
The robot‚Äôs architecture is divided into **hardware**, **software**, and **control logic** modules:

### üîß Hardware
| Module | Component | Function |
|--------|------------|-----------|
| Central Controller | NodeMCU (ESP8266) | Processes sensor data and controls motors/servos |
| Mobility | DC motors + L298N driver | Enables forward, reverse, and turn movement |
| Cleaning | Rotating brush motor | Sweeps debris into collection bay |
| Waste Detection | Soil moisture sensor | Classifies waste as wet (organic) or dry (inorganic) |
| Segregation | SG90 servo motor | Directs waste into correct bin |
| Navigation | IR line sensors | Detects and follows cleaning paths |
| Obstacle Detection | Ultrasonic sensors | Avoids obstacles within range |
| Power System | Battery + Regulator | Ensures stable voltage for all modules |

---

## üß≠ Control Logic
1. **Initialization:** Calibrates sensors and motors; connects to Wi-Fi if enabled.  
2. **Line Following:** IR sensors guide the robot along a predefined path.  
3. **Cleaning:** Front brush sweeps debris while moving forward.  
4. **Waste Detection:** Sensors detect debris and trigger classification.  
5. **Segregation:**  
   - Wet ‚Üí Directed to wet waste bin  
   - Dry ‚Üí Directed to dry waste bin  
6. **Obstacle Avoidance:** Ultrasonic sensors detect and reroute around objects.  
7. **IoT Logging (Future):** Transmits data to cloud for monitoring and analytics.
